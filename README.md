# EvoGym Robot Evolution

This project explores evolutionary algorithms to optimize soft robots in [EvoGym](https://evolutiongym.github.io/). It covers three core areas:

## Project Topics

- **Evolving Structure**  
  Optimization of robot morphology (voxel layout) using evolutionary strategies to improve task performance.

- **Evolving Controller**  
  Evolution of neural controllers for a fixed robot structure, focusing on locomotion and task-solving ability.

- **Evolving Structure and Controller**  
  Co-evolution of both the robot's physical structure and its controller using cooperative optimization methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- EvoGym 2.0.0
- NumPy 1.23.5
- Torch 2.5.1
- Gymnasium 2.0.0
- Imageio 2.36.1
